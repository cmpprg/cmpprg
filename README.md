### Hi there 👋
My name is Ryan Camp.
I am currently working with [SingleOps](https://singleops.com/) fullstack on a RoR app.
I am learning a lot obout JS integration and configurations at this time. Also, learning about micro frontends via a udemy course, which we may be implementing soon. 
That all being said, my first love and background is with Ruby / Ruby on Rails.
I love learning new tech and having conversations about its use.
Please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn: [Ryan Camp LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/campprg/)
