### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Ryan Camp.
I am currently working with [Astra Labs](https://www.withastra.org/) on the Aetheria project.
I am learned Django, Django Rest Framework for this project for the Backend. Also, took on the Front End using VueJs. As a team we are currently transitioning to using Dart / Flutter for mobile development.
I love learning new tech and having conversations about its use.
